    I tried to create a Kindle website which allows users to save the books available in the database and also search
the internet using a google api. The Register and Login allows users to use the website with their own accounts.
application.py contains all the python code that governs the website building upon the Finance model in pset7. The search function
was implemented using the google developer website and geek code academy which especially helped in inputting the image and having
hyperlinks attached to it. The search page is hyperlink which is only linked with the style.css file and script.js. I also
made the lookup function in the helpers.py which takes title price and author only from the database. The issue I would like to solve
in the future is somehow link the information given in API and use that instead of the database since the database relies on a
constant set of data that I ended up inputting myself. I used a few csv files before but a lot of them had unneccessary attributes
and csv file with information about books was not free to use as such I had to manually make a database.
    In order to find the price of a book the user can simply go to quote and input the name of a book. If the book is available in the database table
(journal1) then quote returns price of the book. You can use Add Book to save the book in your collection(which is also a database table).
Moreover, in order to provide the user with better online reading experience, the search functionality is implemented. Since,
this use google api the information available is basically all the google books and as such this search functionality compliments
the user of Kindle website by allowing the user to read about books, their authors etc.
