# Analyze This

## Questions

1a. ALgorithm is correct

1b. O(n). The amount of time it takes Stelios to sort the deck depends on the number of cards. Since he goes through each card
    the time taken is proportional to the number of cards being read.

2a. Algorithm is correct

2b. O(n^2). Similar to bubble sort first iteration requires going through all the elements followed by n-1 elements on the way back
    and then n-2 and so on until only comparison occurs. This results in a running time of O(n^2)

3a. Algorithm is correct.

3b. O(n). In the worst case scenario, Natalie would not find the card until she goes through the entire deck of cards which means
    she is operating on each element once implying that runtime is proportional to the number of elements.
