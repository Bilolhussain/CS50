# Comparing Students

## Questions

1.1. This is the comparator function which for two arguments in general(and in this case 2 values in the array) employs the logic
    to decide the relative order in the sorted output.

1.2. a and b must be typecast in order to dereference them. const void * defines pointer with unknown type and since it's unknown
    you can't dereference it which we need(by typecasting to const int *) to do in order to get the int value of a and b

1.3. See `students.c`.

1.4. See `students.py`.

1.5. See `students.js`.
