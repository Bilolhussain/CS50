## Questions

5.1. CSV is advantageous when the data is flat list of fields as it is simpler to parse through. In this case CSV is easier to handle
     unlike JSON for example it can be handled/read/altered using even Excel which is a user-friendly software.

5.2. JSON's usability is better than CSV as JSON does a better job at displaying hierarchical data because of its well defined schemas.

5.3. https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY&symbol=NFLX&interval=1min&apikey=NAJXWIA8D6VN6A3K&datatype=csv

5.4. A lot of the times the object contains same values for different keys(open , high, low, close) so a way to reduce the rows in
     an object and to reduce excessive scrolling, the keys that have the same value for an object can be concantenated to be put on the
     same row eg open & high : 71.209.
